# Data-Science-Projects
In this project, I apply logistic regression, decision trees, and XGBoost to classify customers with a high probability of churning from a bank. I compare the performance of each model using key evaluation metrics and propose actionable strategies to retain at-risk clients. This project combines business understanding with data science to address a real-world classification problem.
