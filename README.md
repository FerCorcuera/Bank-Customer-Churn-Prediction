# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to build a predictive model to identify bank customers at high risk of churning (i.e., closing their accounts). By leveraging machine learning techniques and customer profile data, we propose a data-driven approach to improve retention strategies and reduce revenue loss due to customer attrition.
# Business Context
XYZ Bank is a retail banking institution operating in France, Spain, and Germany. It offers a range of financial products including checking and savings accounts, credit cards, and investment services. Recently, the bank has observed a rise in customer churn, with a significant proportion of attrition occurring in the 30–60 age group.

- **Overall churn rate**: 4.2%
- **High-risk age segment**: 30–60 years old (88.27% of all churn cases)
- **Economic impact**: Based on industry benchmarks, the average customer lifetime value (LTV) is estimated at €1,800, and the customer acquisition cost (CAC) at €400. This implies a net loss of €1,400 for every customer who leaves the bank.

### Project Objectives

The project has both business and technical goals:

- **Business Objective**: Deploy a predictive system within the bank’s CRM that automatically triggers proactive retention protocols. These may include personalized offers, benefit adjustments, or alerts for at-risk customers based on model-driven segmentation.

- **Analytical Objective**: Develop a machine learning model with at least **85% prediction accuracy** to classify customers by churn risk. The goal is to reduce the overall churn rate by **at least 10%** over the next six months. The final model should be deployment-ready by the end of the current fiscal quarter.
